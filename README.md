This report demonstrates the efficacy of AI techniques, including deep learning and machine learning algorithms, in accurately predicting wine quality. Models like CNN, Random Forest, MLP, and LSTM have proven their adaptability and efficiency, especially when optimized with advanced activation functions like Leaky ReLU.
However, the study reveals that clustering techniques such as Mean Shift, K-means, and Agglomerative Clustering performed poorly in wine quality classification. This suggests the need for more advanced clustering or ensemble methods to achieve better results.
The report emphasizes the significance of data normalization, which greatly influences the performance of models like MLP. It also raises ethical and social concerns associated with AI solutions in sensitive industries like wine production, stressing the importance of transparency, accountability, and stringent data privacy measures.
